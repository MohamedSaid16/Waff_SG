   - Admin → `/admin/dashboard`

## 2) Navigation Basics

- The Navbar shows the pages available for your role.
- Some pages are protected and require login.
- Notifications can be accessed at:
  - `/notifications`

## 3) Notifications

Notifications inform you about important events:

Common actions:
